## International Trade

This repository gathers research materials related to the forthcoming book *Countries Do Not Trade, Firms Do*, which develops a firm-centric and data-driven perspective on international trade, production networks, and economic interdependencies. The book project is ongoing. Draft chapters, replication materials, and related working papers are progressively made available here.

The repository is intended to support transparency, cumulative research, and reproducibility, and to serve as a companion space for pre-publication outputs associated with the project.
