## Conceptual Orientation of the Book

*Countries Do Not Trade, Firms Do* advances a firm-centric interpretation of international trade that departs from country-level abstractions dominant in classical and contemporary trade theory. The core argument is that trade outcomes are shaped less by national endowments or aggregate comparative advantages than by the organization, coordination, and strategic behavior of firms embedded in production networks, supply chains, and platforms. This perspective integrates insights from international economics, industrial organization, economic geography, and data science, emphasizing micro-founded mechanisms, network structures, and real-time data.

The book combines theoretical discussion with empirical analyses based on granular firm- and industry-level data, network methods, and computational approaches. Particular attention is given to resilience, misallocation, algorithmic coordination, and the evolving role of data and computing power as strategic assets in global trade. The working papers hosted or referenced in this repository constitute building blocks of the broader argument and, in several cases, correspond directly to draft chapters.

## Provisional Mapping Between Working Papers and Book Chapters

The paper *Historical and contemporary evolution of international trade: From mercantilism to the platform economy* serves as the conceptual foundation of the book and corresponds to the introductory chapter, which situates the firm-centric approach within the long-run evolution of trade regimes, from mercantilist structures to digitally mediated and platform-based economies.

The paper *Gravity models versus comparative advantage: It is not enough for trade to be free; trade should also be fit* informs an early theoretical chapter reassessing dominant modeling frameworks in international trade. This chapter critiques aggregate gravity-based approaches and argues for a reorientation toward firm-level fitness, matching, and production constraints.

The paper *Not efficient, not optimal: The biases that built global trade and the data tools that could fix it* contributes to a chapter focused on structural inefficiencies and path dependencies in global trade. This chapter examines how historical biases persist through institutional and informational frictions, and how modern data infrastructures could enable corrective mechanisms.

The paper *Beware diworsification: A firm- and supply-chain approach to trade resilience* corresponds to a central chapter on resilience and diversification. It develops a micro-level interpretation of trade resilience that contrasts naïve diversification strategies with network-aware, firm-level adaptation.

The papers *Cross-border producer price transmission in North American manufacturing: Evidence from Canada–United States industry networks* and *Economic interdependencies in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Region: A dynamic analysis of manufacturing connectedness* jointly inform an empirical chapter on regional production networks. This chapter demonstrates how price transmission, shocks, and adjustments propagate through interconnected industries rather than across countries as homogeneous units.

The paper *Territorial control of data and compute in generative AI: A new paradigm of competitive advantage* feeds into a forward-looking chapter on data, computing power, and sovereignty in international trade. This chapter argues that control over data and compute increasingly conditions firms’ international competitiveness, with implications for trade policy and industrial strategy.

The paper *GDP 5.0: Real-time, micro-founded and sustainable metrics for beyond-GDP economic assessment* informs a methodological chapter proposing alternative measurement frameworks consistent with firm-level and network-based trade analysis.
