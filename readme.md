For the remaining working papers in your list, I have identified the series assignment through CIRANO’s publication registry but have not yet found persistent DOI or stable URLs in publicly indexed sources. Below are the CIRANO working paper identifiers that you can use to construct stable access links (CIRANO often provides direct PDF downloads at URLs of the form `https://cirano.qc.ca/files/publications/<identifier>.pdf` once issued):
